# TypeScript Script Tutorial

This project contains example code explained in the Medium article [The Contradictions of Writing a Standalone Script in TypeScript](https://medium.com/@jjdanek/the-contradictions-of-writing-a-standalone-script-in-typescript-2c938a915efa).

This project could also be used as a boilerplate project for creating your own standalone TypeScript scripts.

The only additional feature here not represented in the Medium article is the `scripts` block of package.json. There is a `yarn execute` command which runs the `ts-node src/index.ts` command.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
1. Execute `yarn install`
1. Now running `yarn execute` should work.
