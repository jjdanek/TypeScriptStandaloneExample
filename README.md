# TypeScript Script Tutorial

This project contains example code explained in the Medium article [The Contradictions of Writing a Standalone Script in TypeScript]()

This project could also be used as a boilerplate project for creating your own standalone TypeScript scripts.

The only additional feature here not represented in the Medium article is the `scripts` block of package.json. There is a `yarn execute` command which runs the `ts-node src/index.ts` command.
